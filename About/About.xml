This is a forked version of real faction guest (Continued), I rewrite most of it's code comparing to Mlie's continued version. So I forked it (packageID is different, you don't need to unsubscribe Mlie's version, and don't load both of them), you don't need use this version since they have same function, unless you get issue with Mlie's version or just you want to.

Source code is here or for reporting issues
github: https://github.com/rtxyd/RealFactionGuest

Mlie's continued mod is here for more details

[h1]Preview[/h1]
In rimworld, There is an issue where pawns that come in event or quests are forcibly changed to vanilla pawns type even though they are mod factions.

* This mod solves event / quest pawn issues for 
all of mod human/non-human factions, vanilla expended faction, races added as human alien races, and races added as garam races.

* So you can meet real faction pawns added as mods in various situations.



[h1]Compatible[/h1]
- Saved Game Compatible (Only new Event or Quest)



[h1]Incompatible[/h1]
- Empire mod



[b]Please take this mod and modify it. The source code is included.
I'd love to see variations come out with various ideas.
I'm a game designer, and I haven't implemented many ideas yet due to lack of time.
If you are proficient in C# and are interested, please contact me on the rimworld discord.[/b]
